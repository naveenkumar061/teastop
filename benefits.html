        <p class="benefits-text">
          According to recent studies, drinking tea may considerably reduce the
          chance of developing major cardiac conditions like blood clots and
          heart attacks. Tea has anti-inflammatory qualities that aid to calm
          artery tissue. This reduces the possibility of inflammation, which can
          obstruct blood flow and lead to clotting. Consuming tea may also help
          lower cholesterol and high blood pressure. According to one study,
          persons who drank four or more cups of green tea per day had
          significantly lower levels of harmful LDL cholesterol and a 32% lower
          risk of heart attack.

        <h4 class="benefits-title">enhances energy</h4>
        <p class="benefits-text">
          Caffeine, which is included in green tea in modest amounts, may help
          with boosting energy. L-theanine, an amino acid, is another factor
          that contributes to green tea's energising effects. The caffeine's
          absorption is slowed by this amino acid. As a result, green tea
          provides an energy boost that lasts longer and is more consistent than
          one from a cup of coffee. Without experiencing jittery side effects or
          a crash after the caffeine wears off, you'll have more energy and
          focus. In addition to helping to boost focus and having calming and
          relaxing effects, L-theanine also causes an increase in alpha waves in
          the brain.

        <p class="benefits-text">
          Due to its chemical make-up, green tea may hasten weight loss. Amino
          acids included in green tea tell the body to start burning fat that
          has been accumulated. Additionally, the caffeine in it gives you an
          energy boost, enabling you to exercise more effectively. Popular
          weight-loss supplement green tea extract claims to hasten weight loss.
          Simply put, green tea extract is green tea leaves that have been
          condensed. Additionally, green tea keeps you hydrated and could fulfil
          your sweet taste. Since green tea contains no calories, you can savour
          as many cups as you desire without feeling bad.

        <p class="benefits-text">
          Stress levels have been shown to decline and neurological illness risk
          to reduce with regular tea use. Consuming green tea has also
          demonstrated potential in avoiding cognitive loss brought on by brain
          disease. Antioxidants in tea protect healthy cells from oxidative
          stress, which can harm them. Additionally, antioxidants aid in the
          removal of pollutants from the body that may harm mental health. There
          is evidence that regular tea drinkers have reduced levels of stress
          and better overall health.

        <p class="benefits-text">
          Tea consumption may assist in controlling blood sugar levels and
          preventing or treating conditions like type 2 diabetes. After a meal,
          black tea has been demonstrated to lower blood sugar levels. After
          eating a meal, the benefits were seen for up to 120 minutes.
          Researchers credit tea's polyphenol content for these health
          advantages. These polyphenols boast antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
          properties.

        <p class="benefits-text">
          Tea aids in digestion and can be used to treat a variety of
          conditions, including nausea, upset stomach, and diarrhoea. In China
          and India, ginger tea is a traditional herbal remedy for stomach
          discomfort. To stop vomiting, the substances shogaol and gingerol work
          to calm the stomach lining. Because it contains a lot of menthol and
          antioxidants, peppermint tea also aids in soothing an upset stomach.
          Tannins, which are also included in tea, have been demonstrated to
          lessen intestinal inflammation. This can be used to treat irritable
          bowel syndrome and ease stomach pains.
